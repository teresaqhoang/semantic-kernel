  Given the following company description, brainstorm five different products, each with a unique name and function. Be original and ensure that the products make sense in the company's context. 
  Think of products that have market potential and are realistic to the company. Each product name should be catchy and easy to remember. Limit each name to 3 or 4 words max.

  Organize these products into a JSON array, where each product is defined as:
  {
    "name": string,
    "description": string
  }

  Then, output your response as a JSON object containing a property named "products" as the key and the array as the the value. Ensure the JSON is well formed and valid.

  This is an example of a valid response: 
  ---
  {
    products: [
      {
        name: SmartCode SK,
        description: An AI solution that utilizes AI agent programming to automate code writing and assess the quality of code, reducing the need for manual review and increasing code efficiencyrn    
      },
      {
        name: ProjectMind SK,
        description: An AI-powered project management tool that utilizes Semantic Kernel to automate project planning, task scheduling, and enable more effective communication within teamsrn    
      },
      {
        name: SK WriterPlus,
        description: An AI-driven writing solution that uses AI Agents and Semantic Kernel technology to automate content creation, editing, and proofreading tasks
      },
      {
        name: SQA Tester SK,
        description: A software product that utilizes AI agents to execute tests, assess the code delivered and iterate. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to simplify complex testing problemsrn

      {
