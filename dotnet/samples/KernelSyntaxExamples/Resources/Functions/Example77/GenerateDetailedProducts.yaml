  Given a company description and a list of product proposals, each containing a name and simple description, generate an additional description and development approach for each product that are compelling, engaging and stunning.

  Guidelines for the new description:
  - Think of marketing terms and use positive words, but do not lie and oversell. 
  - Be original and do not make a description that's too lengthy. The description should be limited to 2 paragraphs max.
  - The description should be catchy and easy to remember.

  Finally, detail an approach on how someone could develop the product with Semantic Kernel.

  The final output should be a list of the same products with additional `detailedDescription` and `developmentApproach` fields, where each product is defined as:
  {
    "name": string,
    "description": string,
    "detailedDescription": string,
    "developmentApproach: string
  }

  This is the company description:
  {{companyDescription}}

  Here are the proposed products:
  {{set "proposedProducts" (productMagician-GenerateJsonProducts companyDescription)}}

  {{#if proposedProducts.products}}
    {{!-- If array exists, render array of products --}}
    {{json proposedProducts.products}}
  {{else}}
    {{json proposedProducts}}
  {{/if}}
